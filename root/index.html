      <h1>About</h1>

      <article>
        <p>Like the header says my name is Miles Wells and I've been a professional software developer since May of 2016
          when I graduated from NC State and joined <a href="#DudeSolutions">Dude Solutions</a>. Over the years I've
          developed a passion for TypeScript and will advocate for its use everywhere applicable. My wheelhouse is web
          based architecture so TypeScript often fits right in!</p>

        <h4>Hobbies & Interests</h4>
        <p><strong>Video Games</strong> - I feel fortunate to live in a time where video games not only exist, but
          access to them is unprecedented. Sometimes I need an activity more engaging than something
          like watching a movie but I want to relax and deny myself productivity. Here's a few of my favorites!</p>

        <p><strong>Music</strong> - I'm pretty much always listening to something. Music helps me focus as it prevents
          my mind from wandering as much. I played instruments for the first 20ish years of my life. I started with
          violin and later moved to guitar. Never got any good as I reached the skill plateu and didn't put in the
          effort to break through it. Instead every once in a while now I'll pick guitar up again and see what sweet
          riffs I can remember! For a selection of my tastes here are some of my favorite bands:</p>

        <p><strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> - I've played MTG (Magic: The Gathering) on and off since around 2008.
          My favorite format is cube draft. Getting to play with powerful cards from the nearly 30 years of the game's
          history is great fun. There are also cubes that have themes rather than just powerful cards which can make
          them more interesting than simply playing good cards. I built a cube of
          my own containing mostly just cards I own. There's still about 20 cards I still don't have, but unfortunately
          they can be prohibitively expensive! If you're a fellow spell slinger <a
            href="https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/4309026#paper" target="_blank">here's my cube list</a> which does
          <i>not</i> include the 20 cards I've got proxied so the cube is actually playable!

        </header>
        <p>Our infrastructure at SVT has two main parts. First is the SOFTBOT Studio. The Studio is our cloud platform
          where customers can orchestrate systems of robotics and automation technology however they need to accomplish
          their goals. After some configuration this orchestration gets converted into a package of several containers
          (SOFTBOTs) responsible for the orchestration of singular pieces of technology. These containers can be pushed
          or manually downloaded and comprise of the second part: the SOFTBOT runtime. This runtime is what actually
          does the business of managing the various technologies our customers require. Together these two parts come
          together to create the first codeless robotics automation platform.</p>
        <p>Before we stood up the SOFTBOT platform there were multiple projects we completed as professional services.
          Essentially we offered our expertise to get some initial customers and build a name for SVT while designing
          and building the architecture for the mass undertaking that is the SOFTBOT platform and runtime.</p>

            <h4>Powering Healthcare with Data</h4>
          </hgroup>
        </header>
        <p>My first duty at Validic was to complete the next phase of a project already in progress. This
          project was part of professional services we offered and was unrelated to Validic's core products. The
          company we were hired by developed a blood glucose meter with self-contained cartridges that pricked your
          skin and tested your blood glucose levels all in one package without the need for a full lancer and test
          strip kit. We were responsible for buliding the diabetes monitoring platform they wanted to pair with their
          new device.</p>
        <p>A large part of Validic's business is Inform, a healthcare platform for streaming personal health data.
          This data is sourced via integrations with nearly 500 digital health technologies. I worked on the Impact
          team which utilized Inform to build a remote patient monitoring platform. One of my larger successes on this
          team was implementing a middleware layer that could handle SSO connections using SAML and OIDC so we could
          embed Impact into Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems.</p>

            <h4>Operations Management Software for Smarter Operations</h4>
          </hgroup>
        </header>
        <p>Per their tagline, Dude Solutions builds operations management software. My time at Dude Solutions was mostly
          spent learning the ins and outs of design and implementation of RESTful APIs in both Node and .NET (Framework
          and later Core). I was also introduced to containerization through Docker and even spearheaded an effort to
          Dockerize our Node services since at the time we only had our .NET services containerized. Another Node
          related initiative I undertook was building our first services (in Node) with WebSockets. Our primary uses for
          WebSockets were real-time updates and alerts for concurrent resource access.</p>
        <p>I also spent time working on internal tooling for our customer support team. We automated our new client
          process which involved some fairly painful legacy SalesForce integrations! Other valuable tools include an
          internal SAML configuration tool usable by our support staff so our engineers weren't constantly contacted
          just to add a new configuration and client impersonation tools for live support sessions.</p>

        <img src='./images/html5.svg' />
        <img src='./images/css3.svg' />

        <p>The purpose of this site is twofold. First, just as the title suggests, this site acts as my digital business
          card. This is who I am to the professional world. Second I'm going to use this site as a place to index the
          personal projects I feel are complete enough to host somewhere.</p>
        <p>This site uses <a href="https://picocss.com/" target="_blank">picocss</a> to create a minimalist look with
          mostly just semantic HTML. The goal is to create a small footprint and load fast. This effort may be negated
          because I'm currently hosting this on a VSS and time-to-first-byte may be quite slow.</p>
